    <p>
      You're probably trying to install the PlanktoScope software distro, but
      this is not the correct URL to do that! You should refer to the
      PlanktoScope project documentation's
      <a href="https://docs-edge.planktoscope.community/setup/software/">software setup instructions</a>.
